Steps:

1) Generate/Collect the original bench files of original IP design using OpenROAD.
2) The bench folder have subdirectories of all IPs and original bench file.
bench file format original designName_orig.bench
3) synScripts folder contain subdirectories of all IPs and 1500 synthesis scripts.
4) Each synthesis script will dump intermediate and final AIGs of the synthesis flow in bench folder of the IP numbered by
   syn0, syn1, ... syn1499
5) automate_synthesisScriptGen: Generate the synthesisScripts for each IPs and dump it in directory synScripts
6) automate_bulkSynthesis: Generate the shell script file running 1500 synthesis script for the design IP
7) automate_createSyn1500Dir: Creates 1500 directory from syn0,syn1,...syn1499 in bench folder for a given IP
8) After bench files are generated, use automate_bench2Graphml.py. This will create shell script for each IP which performs the following steps:
   i) Unzip syn0.zip from bench folder
   ii) Parallel run of bench2graphml for 20 bench files in a syn directory. Wait till all are complete. Once done, remove the
       bench folder and zip the graphml folder.
