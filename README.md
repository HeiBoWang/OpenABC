## Overview

**OpenABC-D** is a large-scale labeled dataset generated by synthesizing open source hardware IPs using state-of-art logic synthesis tool **yosys-abc**. We consider 29 open-source hardware IP designs collected from various sources (MIT-CEP, IWLS, OpenROAD, OpenPiton etc) and synthesized them with 1500 random synthesis flows (we call them *synthesis recipes*).


Each synthesis flow has a predefined length **L** (L=20, in our case). We preserved all AIGs: starting, intermediate and final AIGs with labels like number of nodes, longest path, sequence of atomic synthesis transofrmations (*rewrite*, *refactor*, *balance* etc.) along with graph statistics, area and delay of final AIG. 

We converted the AIGs in **pytorch** data format that can be directly used by a machine learning engineer lessening the effort of costly labeled data generation and pre-processing. **OpenABC-D** can be used for a variety of learning tasks on logic synthesis such as

1. Predicting quality of result (QoR) performance of a *synthesis recipe* on a hardware IP. 
2. Area and delay prediction post techonolgy mapping.
3. Learn functional and structural features of AIG using self-supervised labels (useful for tasks like RL-based logic synthesis)

Our dataset can easily be used for graph-based machine learning framework like [Pytorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric). The data generation pipeline of **OpenABC-D** is shown as follows:

## Installing dependencies

We recommend using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment to install pre-requisites packages for running our framework and models.
We list down the packages which we used on our side for experimentations. We recommend installing the packages using *requirements.txt* file provided in our repository.

- cudatoolkit = 10.1
- numpy >= 1.20.1
- pandas >= 1.2.2
- pickleshare >= 0.7.5
- python >=3.9
- pytorch = 1.8.1
- scikit-learn = 0.24.1
- torch-geometric=1.7.0
- tqdm >= 4.56
- seaborn >= 0.11.1
- networkx >= 2.5
- joblib >= 1.1.0

Here are few resources to install the packages (if not using *requirements.txt*)

- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Torch-geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)
- [Networkx] (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html)

Make sure that that the cudatoolkit version in the gpu matches with the pytorch-geometric's (and dependencies) CUDA version.
