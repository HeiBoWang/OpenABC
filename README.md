## Overview

**OpenABC-D** is a large-scale labeled dataset generated by synthesizing open source hardware IPs using state-of-art open source logic synthesis tool **yosys-abc**. We consider 29 open-source hardware IP designs collected from various sources like IWLS, OpenROAD, OpenPiton etc, and performed combinational logic synthesis with 1500 random synthesis flows (we hereby call them *synthesis recipes*) using **yosys-abc**. Each synthesis flow is of a predefined length **L**. We preserved all AIGs: starting, intermediate and final AIGs with labels like number of nodes, longest path, sequence of atomic synthesis transofrmations applied along graph statistics and area and delay of final AIG. These AIGs are converted and stored in **pytorch** data format which can be used for a variety of learning tasks using framework [Pytorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric). **OpenABC-D** framework provides an automated framework
